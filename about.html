                My name is Krish Kumar Gautam, and I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science and Engineering AI ML.
                I have a strong passion for technology and solving complex problems through code.
                My journey began with basic programming, and I have since expanded into web development.
                I enjoy learning new frameworks and tools to improve my workflow and design capabilities.
                In my free time, I love to read tech blogs and contribute to open-source communities.
